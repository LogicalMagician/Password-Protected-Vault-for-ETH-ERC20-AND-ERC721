This smart contract creates a password-protected vault that can hold ETH, ERC20 tokens, and ERC721 tokens. The password is set during deployment and can be changed by the owner of the contract. The password is hashed before it is stored on the blockchain to make it difficult for someone to read it.

To deposit ETH, ERC20 tokens, or ERC721 tokens, you can send them directly to the contract's address. To withdraw, you need to call the withdrawETH, withdrawERC20, or withdrawERC721 function with the correct password and the address where you want to withdraw the tokens.
